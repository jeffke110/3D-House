# 3D-House
https://jeffke110.github.io/3D-House/
This 3D Building Modeling project is a JavaScript project that allows users to interact with a 3D representation of a building. The goal of the project is to create a wire-frame model of a building and provide the ability to toggle between wire-frame and face-colored modes. The view can be rotated by dragging the mouse, providing a dynamic and interactive experience.

Features
Draw a building similar to the provided reference image.
Toggle between wire-frame and face-colored modes using mouse clicks on the canvas.
Rotate the view by dragging the mouse.
When in face-colored mode, color all the faces/surfaces of the building.
Use solid colors for each face, allowing for easy distinction between different surfaces.
Use light-blue panes to represent windows on the building.
Avoid using P3D, WEBGL, or web3D when creating the canvas in the setup function.
