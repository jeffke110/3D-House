# 3D-House

This is a 3D model of a house on a 600x600 canvas. I used a 600x600 canvas so that it is easier to see the house.
There are two modes (face mode and wire mode). Face mode allows the user to see a colored version of the home
and wire mode allows the user to see the wire frame of the house by pressing enter
